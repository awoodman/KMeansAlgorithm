Intermediate Programming - Programming Assignment 2

I created a point class and implemented all of the necessary member functions and friend functions in the Point.cpp implementation file.  This allows us to do things like add points together, compare points, etc.

I then created a cluster class, which is meant to contain points.  The cluster class allows us to do things like add points, subtract points, add other clusters, subtract clusters, etc.  Every point in the cluster(s) are stored in lexicographic order.

The code was not tested yet, because I have not been able to get the cluster << operator to work, yet.
